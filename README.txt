This project is a cooking website that displays recipes (David's Delectables).
Its main three pages are a home page, a recipe page, and a contact page.
Each page begins with the "company's" logo for the website that links to the
home page, as well as a nav element that links each main webpage.

The home page simply displays a greeting message and, in the footer, an option
to sign up for a newsletter by providing a name and email.

The recipe page displays all current recipes in a table that divides them into
categories. Each food item provides a link that brings the user to a separate
page devoted to each recipe. Each individual recipe page provides a note, an
unordered list of instructions, and an ordered list of directions.

The contact page allows the user to enter their first and last name,
and send a message with a subject.

Any page that is expected to be long enough to scroll at some point has
a "back to top" button for ease of use.
